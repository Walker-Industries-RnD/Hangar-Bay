Atop this, the framework of HangarBay makes the system nearly engine agnostic.HangarBay uses Pariah Cybersecurity, promising PQC Cryptographic Resistance.HangarBay separates mod creation, mod validation, and mod execution into clearly defined stages, ensuring unsafe or malformed content never reaches the engine runtime. First, developers create a Mod Type, which is signed publicly and has a ruleset regarding what asset types are/aren't allowed and what DLLs are/aren't allowed. Developers then create the ModType, which allows them to create Mods following the rules set by the application developer. They can validate the ModType through it's Public Signature. Finally, users install the mods onto their systems, with the application handling the mods as the developer wishes. Users can enable/disable and uninstall mods. Scripts are compiled and loaded as DLLs Assets are loaded dynamically at runtime through content manager Because of the way HangarBay works, you can save items as a prefab which can then be loaded into the scene (Scripts and all) HangarBay follows three rules:\nNever trust mods\nAlways validate\nMake creation easy, execution strict\nIt is designed for scale, experimentation, and public mod ecosystems.\n“Mods should be powerful, not dangerous.” Pariah Cybersecurity (And it's dependencies)\nStride3D (Or Stride.CommunityTooklit for minimalists)\nDouglasDwyer.CasCore\nHangarBay does not rely on editor-time compilation.At runtime:\nScript DLLs are loaded\nPrefabs and assets are deserialized\nComponents bind automatically\nExecution hooks are called\nIf a mod contains a spinning cube prefab, the cube spins. No special handling required.HangarBay includes several layers of protection to keep mods safe and isolated like: CAS for Simple Yet Effective Policy Setting User-specific HMAC-SHA256 signatures verify mod activation files (.enabled + .sig) — only the user who enabled the mod can make it work. AES-256 encryption protects all stored secrets (including post-quantum signing keys) inside an encrypted secret bank. Each mod runs with its own isolated ContentManager and virtual filesystem root — no asset overwriting or path conflicts between mods. Strict mod type rules enforce allowed / required / forbidden file extensions and DLL names before a mod is loaded. Mod DLLs are checked for: Strong-name / public key match against trusted versions\nExact SHA256 hash comparison Outdated or incompatible mod DLLs can be replaced with newer system versions. Mod type definitions are cryptographically signed using post-quantum algorithms (resistant to future quantum attacks). Mod metadata (images, thumbnails, etc.) includes xxHash values to detect tampering or unauthorized replacement. Secrets are tied to a user passphrase + device fingerprint — keys cannot be easily stolen or moved to another machine. No global asset merging — every mod’s content stays fully separated from the engine and other mods. HangarBay is engine-agnostic by design, focused on Stride3D.However, it is not impossible to make small tweaks and use it on Unity or Godot. In fact, it's likely possible to use with a far greater array of engines thanks to P/Invoke.Mod developers:\nDo not touch engine internals Do not write custom loaders Do not need editor plugins They simply:\nChoose a Mod Type\nAdd assets and scripts\nBuild the mod\nDrop it into Mods/\n<br>Code: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/non-ai-licenses/non-ai-licenses/main/NON-AI-MPL-2.0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/non-ai-licenses/non-ai-licenses/main/NON-AI-MPL-2.0\" target=\"_self\">NON-AI MPL 2.0</a>\nArtwork: — NO AI training.
